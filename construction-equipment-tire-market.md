<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Construction Equipment Tire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pneumatic</li><li>Solid</li><li>Polyurethane</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The construction equipment tire market encompasses three main types: pneumatic, solid, and polyurethane tires. Pneumatic tires, commonly used in construction vehicles, are filled with air to provide cushioning and absorb impacts. Solid tires, typically made of solid rubber, provide durability and puncture resistance but lack cushioning. Polyurethane tires, made of a lightweight material, offer a balance between durability and comfort. Each type caters to different construction needs, with pneumatic tires offering flexibility, solid tires providing toughness, and polyurethane tires offering a lightweight option.</p></p>
