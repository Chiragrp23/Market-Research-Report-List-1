<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Water-Based Floor Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water Soluble Coating</li><li>Water Dilution Coating</li><li>Water Dispersible Coating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Water-based floor coatings are divided into three main types: water-soluble coatings, water dilution coatings, and water dispersible coatings. Water-soluble coatings are completely soluble in water and form film when dried. Water dilution coatings are formulated with a high concentration of resins, requiring dilution with water before application. Once applied, water evaporation allows the formation of a protective film. Water dispersible coatings contain small particles that disperse in water but do not dissolve. These particles form a cohesive film when water evaporates, creating a protective coating on the floor.</p></p>
