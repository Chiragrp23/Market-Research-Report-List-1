<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Complex Fertilizers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Incomplete Complex Fertilizers</li><li>Complete Complex Fertilizers</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Complex fertilizers are a type of fertilizer that contain two or more essential nutrients for plant growth. Incomplete complex fertilizers lack one or more nutrients, usually nitrogen, phosphorus, or potassium, and are used when these specific nutrients are already abundant in the soil. Complete complex fertilizers, on the other hand, have a balanced ratio of all essential nutrients and are used when the soil lacks one or more of these nutrients. Both types of complex fertilizers are designed to improve crop yield and ensure healthy plant growth.</p></p>
