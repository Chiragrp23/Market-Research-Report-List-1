<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Laminated Glass</li><li>Tempered Glass</li><li>Special Function Glass</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive glass market is categorized into three types - laminated glass, tempered glass, and special function glass. Laminated glass is constructed by bonding two or more layers of glass with a layer of polyvinyl butyral (PVB) in between, offering increased safety and sound insulation. Tempered glass undergoes a heating process followed by rapid cooling, making it five times stronger than regular glass, and is commonly used for side windows and rear windshields. Special function glass includes features like acoustic insulation, sun protection, and heads-up displays, enhancing comfort and convenience for the occupants.</p></p>
