<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Catalyst Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Two Way Catalyst</li><li>Three Way Catalyst</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive catalyst market consists of two main types: two-way catalyst and three-way catalyst. A two-way catalyst operates by converting carbon monoxide (CO) and unburned hydrocarbons (HC) into carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). On the other hand, a three-way catalyst not only reduces CO and HC emissions, but also oxidizes nitrogen oxides (NOx) into nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2). Both catalysts are crucial in reducing harmful emissions from vehicles, playing a significant role in enhancing air quality and meeting regulatory standards.</p></p>
