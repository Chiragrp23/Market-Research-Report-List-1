<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Synthetic Zeolite Adsorbents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Regenerative Zeolite Adsorbents</li><li>Non-regenerative Zeolite Adsorbents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Synthetic Zeolite Adsorbents market consists of two main types: Regenerative Zeolite Adsorbents and Non-regenerative Zeolite Adsorbents. Regenerative Zeolite Adsorbents can undergo a cycle of adsorption and desorption without losing their adsorption capacity. This allows them to be reused multiple times. On the other hand, Non-regenerative Zeolite Adsorbents cannot be regenerated and need to be replaced after being used. Although they may have a lower cost, they do not offer the same level of sustainability as regenerative zeolite adsorbents.</p></p>
