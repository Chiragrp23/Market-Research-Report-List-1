<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agriculture Vortex Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed Vortex Pump</li><li>Open Vortex Pump</li><li>Centrifugal Vortex Pump</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Agriculture vortex pumps have three main market types: Closed Vortex Pump, Open Vortex Pump, and Centrifugal Vortex Pump. </p><p>Closed Vortex Pump: It consists of a vortex chamber with a rotor that rotates within it, creating a vortex. It is highly efficient and suitable for handling liquids with solid particles.</p><p>Open Vortex Pump: Similar to the closed type, it also generates a vortex. However, it lacks a casing, making it suitable for handling fluids with high solids content or fibrous materials.</p><p>Centrifugal Vortex Pump: It combines the characteristics of a centrifugal pump with a vortex pump. It creates a vortex but uses a rotating impeller to generate centrifugal force, making it efficient for handling fluids with low solids content or clean liquids.</p></p>
