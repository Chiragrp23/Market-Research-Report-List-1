Bias tyres have been widely used in various applications such as off-road vehicles, light trucks, and agricultural and construction machinery.</p><p>The future outlook for the bias tyre market appears to be promising. The market is expected to experience significant growth during the forecasted period, with a projected Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 9.6%. Key factors contributing to this growth include the rising demand for off-road vehicles and agricultural machinery across emerging economies, as well as the consistent growth of the construction industry worldwide.</p><p>Bias tyres offer several advantages over their radial counterparts, including superior load-carrying capacity, increased durability, and resistance to cuts and punctures. These features, combined with the affordable cost of bias tyres compared to radials, contribute to their continued popularity in various sectors.</p><p>Moreover, the agricultural sector plays a crucial role in driving the demand for bias tyres, as it heavily relies on equipment such as tractors, combines, and harvesters that require robust tires to operate efficiently. With the increasing global population and the continuous modernization of agriculture practices, the demand for bias tyres in this sector is expected to remain strong.</p><p>In conclusion, the future and current outlook of the bias tyre market is optimistic. The market is set to experience substantial growth, supported by factors such as the demand for off-road vehicles, agricultural machinery, and the construction industry. The projected CAGR of 9.6% indicates ample opportunities for manufacturers and suppliers in the bias tyre market to capitalize on this growing demand.</p></p>
