<p><p>A next-generation drug-eluting stent (DES) is an advanced medical device designed to treat coronary artery disease by restoring blood flow through the arteries. These stents are coated with drugs that help prevent restenosis, reducing the risk of reblockage in the treated blood vessel.</p><p>The global market for next-generation drug-eluting stents is projected to grow at a CAGR of 5% during the forecast period. The primary drivers of this market growth include the increasing prevalence of coronary artery disease, an aging population, and advancements in stent technology.</p><p>There is a growing demand for next-generation drug-eluting stents due to their improved safety and efficacy over bare-metal stents. The use of biodegradable polymers has been a major trend in this market, as they eliminate the long-term presence of the stent in the body, reducing the risk of complications and allowing for faster vessel healing.</p><p>Another trend in the next-generation drug-eluting stent market is the introduction of bioresorbable stents, which completely dissolve over time after the vessel has healed. These stents offer advantages such as reduced inflammation, improved vasomotion, and the ability for future treatments if necessary.</p><p>Geographically, North America holds a significant market share in the next-generation drug-eluting stent market due to the high prevalence of cardiovascular diseases and the presence of well-established healthcare infrastructure. However, emerging economies like China and India are expected to witness substantial growth in this market due to the rapidly increasing patient population and improving healthcare facilities.</p><p>In conclusion, the next-generation drug-eluting stent market is set to witness significant growth in the coming years. Advancements in stent technology, the increasing prevalence of coronary artery disease, and the aging population are the primary factors driving this market growth. The use of biodegradable polymers and bioresorbable stents are emerging trends in this market, further propelling its expansion.</p></p>
