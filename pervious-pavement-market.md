<p><strong>The Pervious Pavement Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pervious Concrete</li><li>Porous Asphalt</li><li>Interlocking Concrete Pavers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pervious pavement is a sustainable solution for managing stormwater runoff. Pervious concrete is a type of pavement that allows water to percolate through the surface and into the ground, reducing the strain on stormwater systems. Porous asphalt is another type of pavement that has small voids, allowing water to pass through and infiltrate the soil below. Interlocking concrete pavers are individual units that fit together, creating gaps that allow water to flow through. These different types of paving materials offer various benefits and are used in different applications to promote efficient stormwater management.</p></p>
