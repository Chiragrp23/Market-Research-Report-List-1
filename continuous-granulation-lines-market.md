<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Continuous Granulation Lines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Granulation Line</li><li>Dry Granulation Line</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Continuous granulation lines are used in the production of granular materials, and there are two main types: wet granulation lines and dry granulation lines. Wet granulation lines involve mixing a liquid binder with powders to form granules, which are then dried. This process is commonly used for moisture-sensitive materials. On the other hand, dry granulation lines involve compressing powders into compacted sheets, which are then broken down into granules. This method is typically used for materials that cannot be granulated using a liquid binder. Both types of granulation lines are important in various industries, including pharmaceuticals and chemicals.</p></p>
