<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyester Wax Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>80°C-90°C</li><li>90°C-100°C</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Polyester Wax market can be divided into two main types based on their melting points. The first type ranges from -80°C to 90°C, while the second one ranges from 90°C to 100°C. These temperature ranges indicate the melting point of the waxes, which determines their application suitability. Waxes with a lower melting point (-80°C-90°C) are commonly used in industries like coatings, printing inks, and adhesives. On the other hand, waxes with a higher melting point (90°C-100°C) find applications in areas such as hot-melt adhesives, PVC processing, and rubber compounding.</p></p>
