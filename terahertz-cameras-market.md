<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Terahertz Cameras Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Terahertz Imaging</li><li>Active Terahertz Imaging</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Passive Terahertz Imaging refers to the use of naturally occurring terahertz radiation emitted by objects to capture images. It does not require any external source of terahertz radiation. Active Terahertz Imaging, on the other hand, utilizes a terahertz source to emit radiation towards objects and then captures the reflected signals to form images. It provides more control over the imaging process but requires an additional terahertz source. Both types of cameras are used in various applications including security, electronics, aerospace, and medical imaging.</p></p>
