<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nitrogen Cryogenic Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal</li><li>Positive Displacement</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Nitrogen cryogenic pumps are used to transfer and handle liquid nitrogen at extremely low temperatures. There are two main types of pumps used in the market: centrifugal and positive displacement pumps. Centrifugal pumps utilize a rotating impeller to move the fluid by creating centrifugal force, which helps to push the liquid outwards. On the other hand, positive displacement pumps use a reciprocating motion or rotating mechanism to transfer the fluid by trapping a fixed amount of liquid and forcing it into the discharge pipe. Both types play crucial roles in the efficient and reliable transportation of nitrogen at cryogenic temperatures.</p></p>
