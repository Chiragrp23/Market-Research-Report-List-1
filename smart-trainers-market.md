<p><p>Smart trainers are a type of stationary bike trainers that provide an immersive cycling experience. There are two main market types: wheel-on type and direct drive type. Wheel-on smart trainers utilize a roller to press against the rear wheel, providing resistance. They are generally portable and less expensive. Direct drive smart trainers replace the rear wheel altogether and allow the bike transmission to connect directly to the trainer. This provides a more accurate and realistic feel but is typically pricier and bulkier. Both types offer features like adjustable resistance, connectivity to virtual cycling apps, and data tracking.</p></p>
