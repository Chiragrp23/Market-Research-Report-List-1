<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyurethane Adhesive Sealant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>One-component</li><li>Two-component</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Polyurethane adhesive sealant market is categorized into two types: one-component and two-component. One-component sealants involve ready-to-use products that do not require any additional preparation or mixing. These sealants are convenient for quick and easy applications, as they cure when exposed to air moisture. On the other hand, two-component sealants consist of a base component and a curing agent or activator, which need to be mixed together before application. This type allows for greater control of curing time and is commonly used for larger applications or where longer curing times are required.</p></p>
