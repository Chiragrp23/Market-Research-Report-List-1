<p><strong>The Urinary Stone Treatment Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ureteral Stents</li><li>Nephrolithotomy</li><li>Lithotripsy</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The urinary stone treatment device market consists of various types of devices used for the treatment of urinary stones. Ureteral stents are flexible tubes inserted into the ureter to ensure the flow of urine from the kidney to the bladder. Nephrolithotomy is a surgical procedure involving the removal of kidney stones through a small incision in the back. Lithotripsy uses shock waves to break down kidney stones into smaller fragments, making them easier to pass through the urinary tract. These devices play a crucial role in providing effective treatment options for patients with urinary stones.</p></p>
