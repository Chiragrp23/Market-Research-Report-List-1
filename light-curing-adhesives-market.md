<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Light-curing Adhesives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water-based Adhesive</li><li>Solvent-based Adhesive</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Light-curing adhesives are classified into two types: water-based adhesive and solvent-based adhesive. Water-based adhesives are composed of water as the main solvent, making them environmentally friendly and safer to use. They are commonly used in applications where low toxicity and easy cleanup are preferred. On the other hand, solvent-based adhesives use organic solvents as the main solvent, which evaporate during curing. These adhesives offer excellent adhesion and are suitable for bonding materials that are not water-resistant. However, they may have higher toxicity levels and require careful handling.</p></p>
