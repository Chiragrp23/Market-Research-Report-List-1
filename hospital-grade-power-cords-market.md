<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hospital Grade Power Cords Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>16 AWG</li><li>18 AWG</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Hospital Grade Power Cords market comprises two main types, namely 16 AWG and 18 AWG cords. The differentiation is based on wire gauge, where the American Wire Gauge (AWG) system is used to measure the thickness of the conducting wire inside the cord. A 16 AWG cord has a thicker wire than an 18 AWG cord, allowing for higher power transmission capacity. Hospitals typically require these cords to ensure safe and reliable power supply to medical equipment, with 16 AWG being preferred for devices demanding greater electrical load.</p></p>
