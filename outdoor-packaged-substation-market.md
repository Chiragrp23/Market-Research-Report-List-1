<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Outdoor Packaged Substation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid-Filled Transformers</li><li>Dry Type Transformers</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Outdoor Packaged Substation market consists of two types: Liquid-Filled Transformers and Dry Type Transformers. Liquid-Filled Transformers use a cooling liquid, like oil or silicone, to regulate temperature and maintain efficient operation. These transformers are commonly used in high-power applications. On the other hand, Dry Type Transformers do not rely on liquid for cooling and instead use air to dissipate heat. They are typically used in smaller installations or locations where fire safety is a concern, as they are less flammable.</p></p>
