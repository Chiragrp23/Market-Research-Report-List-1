<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Calcium Superphosphate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>With Water</li><li>Without Water</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Calcium Superphosphate market can be categorized into two types: with water and without water. With water refers to the production of calcium superphosphate wherein water is used as a medium to facilitate the reaction between phosphate rock and sulfuric acid. This process results in a phosphoric acid solution which is further treated with lime to produce calcium superphosphate. Without water, on the other hand, involves the direct reaction of phosphate rock and sulfuric acid without the use of water as a medium. Both methods are utilized in the production of calcium superphosphate for various agricultural applications.</p></p>
