<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mechanical Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pneumatic Piston Devices</li><li>Load Distributing Band Devices</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Mechanical Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) devices are used to provide continuous chest compressions during cardiac arrest. Pneumatic piston devices utilize compressed air to compress the chest, delivering consistent and controlled compressions. These devices are lightweight and portable, making them suitable for pre-hospital and hospital settings. Load Distributing Band devices consist of a constrictive band that wraps around the chest and delivers compressions through a circumferential squeezing mechanism. These devices distribute the force evenly, reducing the risk of rib fractures and injury. Both types of devices offer efficient and effective CPR support.</p></p>
