<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rubber Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bias Tires</li><li>Radial Tires</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The rubber tires market comprises two primary types: bias tires and radial tires. Bias tires are built with multiple layers of fabric cords positioned at angles, creating a crisscross pattern. They offer excellent load-carrying capacity but provide less comfort and fuel efficiency compared to radial tires. Radial tires, on the other hand, feature fabric cords that run radially from bead to bead. They offer better fuel efficiency, comfort, and longer lifespan due to their construction. Both types cater to different requirements and are used in various vehicles and industries.</p></p>
